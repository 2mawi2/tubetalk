**Advertisement/Sponsored Content:**  
   - Include "Sponsored Sections" ONLY if all criteria are met:  
     1. Clear start/end timestamps in the format §[MM:SS]§ to §[MM:SS]§  
     2. Duration longer than 5 seconds  
     3. Contains promotional content, such as:  
        * Discount/promo codes  
        * Product promotions/endorsements  
        * Calls to action ("Check out", "Use code", "Visit")  
        * Sponsor mentions ("Thanks to", "Sponsored by")  
     4. Identifiable sponsor or product mentioned explicitly

   - Formatting (if included):  
     <div class="ad-sections">  
       <h3>Sponsored Sections</h3>  
       <ul>  
         <li>§[MM:SS]§ to §[MM:SS]§ - [Sponsor: brief description of promotional content]</li>  
       </ul>  
     </div>

   - **IMPORTANT: You must use the exact HTML structure shown above - do not modify the class names or HTML structure**
   - **IMPORTANT: Format must be exactly as shown in the example with the same tags, spacing, and attributes**
   - **IMPORTANT: Always format timestamps consistently as §[MM:SS]§**
   - **DO NOT write this section in plain text or with markdown formatting - use only HTML**
   - **DO NOT use asterisks or other markdown syntax - use only proper HTML tags**
   - **This section MUST be included INSIDE the <div class="message-content"> wrapper**
   - DO NOT include placeholder text, 0:00 timestamps, or identical start/end times.  
   - If no sponsored content is present or criteria are not fully met, do not add this section at all.
   
If the transcript indicates a sponsor segment meeting these criteria, you MUST produce this section exactly as shown above. If the test scenario includes a sponsor mention and you've been instructed to show sponsored content, failing to include the <div class="ad-sections"> block will cause an evaluation failure.
