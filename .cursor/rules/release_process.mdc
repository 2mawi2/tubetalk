# Release Process

- **Branching**: Releases are created from the `release` branch.
- **Pre-checks**:
  - Run `just test` (all tests must pass).
  - Run `just lint` and fix any issues.
- **Steps**:
  1. `git checkout release`
  2. `git pull origin release`
  3. `git merge main`
  4. `git push origin release`
- CI will build, publish to the Chrome Web Store, create a GitHub release, and bump version.
- Version is in `extension/manifest.json`; CI bumps patch after publishing.

See [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) for details.
